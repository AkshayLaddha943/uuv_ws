## Purpose of this project:

This project contains ROS packages for development, simulation and testing of:

- 3D Navigation (motion control + mapping) of the eca_a9 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV.)
- A novel 'integrated planning and control (IPC) strategy' developed by [Veejay Karthik](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator) for 3D underwater navigation in using the rexrov model.
